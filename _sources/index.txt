Majordom - open-source home automation control center
=====================================================

Welcome to our home automation control center project!

The Majordom project is led by three engineering students at the
French Engineering School Supelec. It aims at designing a versatile
home automaton control center written in Python. Its main characteristics
are the following :

* **open-source**
   We wish anybody was able to use the prototypes we developed to improve them in the future.
* **modularity**
   The server-side app is plugin-based, making it really easy to add your own functions to the control center.
* **simplicity**
   The choice of Python as the main programming language of the system and the relative simplicity of the software architecture should allow anyone developing plugins.
